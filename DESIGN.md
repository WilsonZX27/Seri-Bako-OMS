# Seri Bako OMS responsive design standard

This document is the implementation contract for every customer-facing route, form, record workspace, table, panel, dialog, and mobile action bar. It applies to new work and to refactoring of existing UI.

## Viewport contract

Design mobile first. The base class or CSS rule must be the 320px–639px experience. Enhancement uses the shared Tailwind thresholds only:

- `640px`: large phone / compact tablet; remains a single-column, touch-first experience.
- `768px`: tablet; the active task keeps the full workspace width. Supporting context opens on demand instead of permanently narrowing forms or item names.
- `1024px`: laptop desktop; dense line-entry layouts may expand, but a persistent inspection rail still remains hidden.
- `1280px`: full desktop; left navigation, main workspace, and optional right inspection rail may coexist.

Do not introduce a page-specific breakpoint. These thresholds serve distinct operational contexts, so a 1024px laptop is not forced into a cramped tablet layout and a full three-rail workspace is not shown prematurely. Test representative widths at 320, 390, 640, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, and 2560px.

## Layout contract

- Use `min-w-0` on children of flex/grid layouts that contain text, controls, or tables.
- Use grid fractions, `minmax(0, 1fr)`, flex growth, percentages, or viewport-constrained `min()`/`max()` values for page structure. Do not give a page, panel, or content column a fixed pixel width.
- A dense desktop grid must collapse to one column by default; add the second/third column only at the semantic breakpoints.
- Tables must sit inside `.sb-table-region` or a local `overflow-x-auto` container. The document itself must never become horizontally scrollable.
- A mobile primary action is fixed above the safe area, with enough document bottom padding that the last editable control remains reachable. Its border is neutral; it must not visually imply a completed workflow state.
- Full-width forms use `w-full min-w-0 max-w-full`. A form control may have a minimum touch target (for example quantity entry) but the surrounding layout must still shrink safely.
- Form sections that contain file inputs, long sample values, or native selects must also set `min-w-0` on the containing grid/flex items; native file controls must never widen their parent on narrow screens.

## Mobile Web App shell

The authenticated phone experience is an application-style mobile Web layout, not a scaled desktop sidebar.

- Below `768px`, the primary navigation is a five-slot bottom bar: up to four permission-aware role shortcuts plus `More`.
- `More` opens the complete navigation allowed by the current role and effective permission map. It must never expose an unauthorized route.
- Shortcut destinations are role-aware. Owner and Manager emphasize requests, receiving, and stock count; Finance emphasizes requests, invoices, and stock; Purchasing emphasizes requests, orders, and receiving; Kitchen emphasizes production and assigned operational work; Outlet Staff emphasizes the daily record.
- Every role receives four permission-safe task destinations plus `More` when its effective permissions allow four destinations. Missing permissions fall back only to another authorized destination; navigation never duplicates a shortcut.
- The desktop sidebar remains the authoritative desktop navigation and is unchanged at `1280px` and above.
- The phone top bar uses a fixed three-slot structure: contextual back control on the left, a single centered page title, and workspace notifications on the right. Root workspaces reserve the left slot so the title remains optically centered.
- Company identity, profile, subtitles, and duplicate document labels do not appear in the phone top bar. Profile remains available through `More`; new, edit, and detail routes link back to their parent workspace.
- A phone page must not repeat the same workspace name in the top bar, page header, and document header. New documents show status, branch, workflow position, and the next permitted action beneath the top bar instead of repeating “New [document]” and the module title.
- The bottom bar observes `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`. The top bar observes `env(safe-area-inset-top)`, and the root viewport uses `viewport-fit=cover`.
- A page-level fixed primary action sits above the bottom navigation. It must not cover the final field, the navigation, or the home indicator.
- Pages without contextual actions must not render an empty or generic secondary action bar.
- Mobile sheets lock background scroll, support Escape dismissal, preserve focus, and sit above both navigation and page actions.
- The web manifest uses `display: standalone` so supported browsers may add the OMS to the home screen without creating a separate native application.

The mobile shell may reorganize navigation, information density, filters, and action placement, but it must reuse the same colors, terminology, permissions, route authorization, document states, and server actions as desktop.

## Typography and spacing

- Use `rem`, `em`, design tokens, or `clamp()` for type and spacing. Do not use screen-specific pixel font sizes or page-level pixel padding.
- Keep labels, status, and instructions concise. On small screens, progressive disclosure is preferred to a long uninterrupted form.
- Use the shared control-height token. Touch controls are at least 44px on mobile; denser desktop controls may use the tablet/desktop token only when their role remains clear.
- Phone controls use the shared 10px control radius and 12px panel radius for an iOS-like touch surface. Tablet and desktop retain the compact 2px enterprise radius.
- Quantity, currency, and date fields must be large enough to enter and review without zooming. Numeric values use tabular figures and retain a visible unit.

## Mobile color and shape language

- Deep operational green is the only normal primary-action, selected-navigation, active-workflow, and keyboard-focus color.
- Warm orange is reserved for warning, urgency, attention, and compact notification cues. It must not compete with green as a second ordinary button color.
- Phone inputs, selects, text areas, buttons, filter triggers, popovers, and legacy 2px surfaces normalize to the shared phone radii. Status and notification badges may remain fully pill-shaped; ordinary cards must not.
- A single phone surface must not mix square legacy fields, rounded mobile fields, green primary buttons, and brown primary buttons.

## Media and content safety

- Every `img`, `video`, `iframe`, `canvas`, `object`, and `embed` is constrained with `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto` unless an explicit aspect-ratio container owns its size.
- Images must have useful alt text unless decorative. They must use `object-fit` deliberately rather than relying on intrinsic dimensions.
- Long IDs, product names, branch names, and imported values must wrap, truncate with an accessible label, or remain in a scrolling subregion; they must never widen the page.

## Operational workflow UX

- The current status and the next permitted action appear before secondary metadata.
- Module landing pages use the operational hub hierarchy: one current-day summary, one primary task, one attention queue, and one compact tool list. They do not use repeated icon-card directories or duplicate explanatory copy.
- The operational hub keeps the same information order on phone and desktop. Responsive behavior changes column placement and density, not terminology, color roles, or task priority.
- Summary values share one flat data strip. Semantic orange or red appears only when the corresponding value requires attention; zero and normal states remain operational green.
- A form starts with only the fields needed to begin. Notes, advanced filters, and audit detail use progressive disclosure.
- Line-entry documents place the editable value and unit together, keep theoretical/variance feedback visible, and avoid card height that makes a count feel endless.
- Long repeated tasks show completion progress and provide an in-list find/remaining-items view. A physical count must require an explicit physical value instead of silently copying the theoretical balance.
- Per-line remarks remain directly visible in dense desktop layouts. On touch layouts they may collapse until requested, but must open automatically when a variance makes the reason mandatory.
- Destructive, posting, approval, cancel, and backup actions must state their consequence and remain distinct from save/draft actions.
- Role restrictions must result in an explanatory read-only state, not a missing or broken-looking page.

## Mobile operational surfaces

- A phone workflow uses one boundary per operational unit. Do not place a bordered or shadowed card inside another card merely to group ordinary fields, progress, search, or line items.
- Use a separate setup panel only when the user must establish context before beginning work (for example, date, branch, and tolerance). The repeatable work itself belongs in one continuous operational surface.
- Within a continuous operational surface, use flat section backgrounds and 1px dividers for progress, filters, and rows. Do not wrap those sections in additional cards.
- Preserve the same content hierarchy on desktop, but mobile may split setup from the active work surface to improve scanning and prevent nested-card visual noise.

## Verification gate

A UI change is not complete until:

1. every affected route loads with the global stylesheet parsed;
2. no page-level horizontal overflow occurs at 320, 390, 640, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, or 2560px;
3. every visible link, button, input, select, textarea, and summary remains inside the viewport unless it is inside an explicitly contained scrolling table region;
4. keyboard focus, errors, empty states, loading states, and primary actions remain visible and usable;
5. the related workflow Playwright test passes using isolated local data; and
6. static route layout audit and typecheck/lint/build remain green.

The Playwright route-layout audit is the baseline guard for all static workspaces. Workflow specs provide the mutation/role coverage; neither replaces the other.
